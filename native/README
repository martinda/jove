INTRODUCTION

This package contains GNU Make scripts designed to build (compile, link,
etc.) reusable software components in a platform independent manner. Please
refer to any of my components for an example of its usage.

Currently, C/C++ is the only directly supported language. Java components
are expected to use a tool such as Ant.
