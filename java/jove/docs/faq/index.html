<h2><a name="what_is">What is Jove?</a></h2>
<p>Jove is a set of Java APIs and tools to enable Verilog hardware design verification using the Java programming language. It contains components that accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Verilog simulator interaction (via PLI 2.0, aka VPI)</li>
  <li>standalone behavioral simulation (i.e. a discrete event simulator)</li>
  <li>thread and event synchronization</li>
  <li>design verification abstractions (e.g. clock-relative signal access, mailboxes, semaphores)</li>
  <li>constraint-based randomization</li>
  <li>Verilog shell generation</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, it provides facilities similar to Synopsys Vera, Cadence Testbuilder, and (formerly) Verisity Specman.</p>
<h2><a name="why_is">Why is Jove?</a></h2>
<p>Verification has become a very software-intensive task, and Jove is intended to leverage Java's strengths as a robust software engineering environment to deal with very large, complex verification codebases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jove leverages the Java language, a standard, well-defined, high-productivity object-oriented programming language. Alternative tools introduce proprietary languages, or use more complex, less productive languages, like C/C++ or Perl. </li>
  <li>Jove leverages Java libraries, including the extensive Java runtime library, the JUnit test framework, and thousands of third-party libraries. Java libraries tend to be much easier to integrate than libraries in earlier mature languages, such as C/C++. </li>
  <li>Jove leverages Java tools, such as Javadoc and Eclipse. The Eclipse IDE, for instance, provides Jove users with a free, powerful GUI debugger.</li>
  <li>Jove leverages Java Virtual Machine technology, arguably the most mature, high-performance VM technology available, with performance rivaling compiled languages in most cases.</li>
  <li>Jove leverages the experience of a software-oriented team executing the complete lifecycle of a very complex ASIC verification project. It addresses the limitations encountered using other tools during that project.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="who_wrote">Who wrote Jove?</a></h2>
<p>Jove was created at <a href="http://www.newisys.com/">Newisys, Inc.</a> The project was conceived and architected by Trevor Robinson &lt;<img src="TrevorEmail.png" alt="Trevor's email" width="146" height="14" border="0" />&gt;. Jon Nall &lt;<img src="JonEmail.png" alt="Jon's email" width="171" height="14" />&gt; implemented the random solver and BitVector components, and performed most of the bring-up and testing. Scott Diesing &lt;<img src="ScottEmail.png" alt="Scott's email" width="158" height="14" />&gt; implemented the behavioral simulator. Mark Davis &lt;<img src="MarkEmail.png" alt="Mark's email" width="92" height="14" />&gt; managed the project. Jove also includes some third-party software, listed <a href="#license">below</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="status">What is the status of Jove?</a></h2>
<p>Jove should be considered relatively stable and mature (though like most free software, it carries no warranties of any kind; see the <a href="#license">license</a> for details). It has been in production use for the verification of <a href="http://www.newisys.com/products/horus_external_white_paper_final.pdf">Newisys' Horus ASIC</a>, running a verification codebase of over 400K lines of Java source, since February 2005 and has proven exceptionally stable.</p>
<h3><a name="platforms">What platforms does Jove support?</a></h3>
<p>Most of Jove is written in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/">Java 5.0</a> language, and should therefore work on any platform with a Java 5.0 JDK. Specifically, Java-only behavioral simulations should work on any Java platform. However, the Verilog simulator support is written in C++ and therefore tends to need tweaking to work on new platforms. The table below lists platforms that Jove has been tested on so far.</p>

<h3><a name="simulators">What Verilog simulators does Jove support?</a></h3>
<p>Jove is designed to be easily ported to any simulator supporting PLI 2.0 / VPI. It has been tested with the simulators listed in the table below. We hope that support for other simulators will be forthcoming.</p>
